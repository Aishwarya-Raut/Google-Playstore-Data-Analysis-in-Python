# Google Playstore Data Analysis in Python 📊📱

Welcome to the **Google Playstore Data Analysis** project! 🚀 This project dives into the **Google Playstore dataset** to explore trends, ratings, installs, and other key insights using **Python** and popular libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **NumPy**.

## Project Overview 🧐

In this project, we analyze the **Google Playstore Dataset**, which includes valuable data on apps available in the Playstore. We explore multiple aspects, including ratings, installs, categories, and more. The process involves:

- **Data Cleaning** 🧹: Fixing missing data and handling inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Discovering patterns and trends in the dataset.
- **Data Visualization** 📊: Creating awesome plots to visualize the data.
- **Key Insights** 🧠: Extracting meaningful takeaways from the analysis.

## Dataset 📂

The dataset includes the following columns, which provide key details about each app:

- **App**: Name of the app 📱
- **Category**: Category the app belongs to (e.g., Games, Education) 🎮📚
- **Rating**: Average user rating (out of 5) ⭐
- **Reviews**: Number of user reviews ✍️
- **Size**: App size (in MB) 🧳
- **Installs**: Number of installs (can include '1,000+', '50,000+') 🔢
- **Type**: Paid or Free 💰
- **Price**: Price of the app 💵
- **Content Rating**: Age group (e.g., Everyone, Teen) 👶👦
- **Genres**: Genres of the app 🎧🎲
- **Last Updated**: The date the app was last updated 📅

## Key Visualizations 📈

In this analysis, you will find the following visualizations:

1. **Distribution of Ratings** 🎯: Visualizes how ratings are distributed across all apps.
2. **Category vs Rating** 📊: Examines the relationship between app categories and their average ratings.
3. **Installs vs Rating** 💪: Investigates how the number of installs correlates with app ratings.
4. **Category vs Rating (Boxplot)** 📦: Displays how ratings vary within different categories.
